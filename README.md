# kas-installer

KAS Installer allows the deployment and configuration of Managed Kafka Service
in a single K8s cluster.

## Prerequisites
* [jq][jq]
* [curl][curl]
* [OpenShift][openshift]. In the future there are plans to make it compatible
  with native K8s. Currently an OpenShift dedicated based environment is needed
* [git][git_tool]
* oc
* kubectl
* openssl CLI tool
* A user with administrative privileges in the OpenShift cluster
* brew coreutils (Mac only)

## Description

KAS Installer deploys and configures the following components that are part of
Managed Kafka Service:
* MAS SSO
* Observability Operator
* sharded-nlb IngressController
* KAS Fleet Manager
* KAS Fleet Shard and Strimzi Operators

It deploys and configures the components to the cluster set in
the user's kubeconfig file.

Additionally, a single Data Plane cluster is configured ready to be used, in the
same cluster set in the user's kubeconfig file.

## Usage

### Deploy Managed Kafka Service
1. Create and fill the KAS installer configuration file `kas-installer.env`. An
   example of the needed values can be found in the `kas-installer.env.example`
   file
1. Run the KAS installer `kas-installer.sh` to deploy and configure Managed
   Kafka Service

### Service Account Maintenance

The `service_account.sh` script supports creating, listing, and deleting service accounts.

1. To create an account, run `service_account.sh --create`. The new service account information will be printed to the console. Be sure to retain the `clientID` and `clientSecret` values to use when generating an access token or for connecting to Kafka directly.
1. To list existing service accounts, run `service_account.sh --list`.
1. To remove an existing service account, run `service_account.sh --delete <ID of service account>`.

### Generate an Access Token
1. Run `get_access_token.sh` using the `clientID` and `clientSecret` as the first and second arguments. The generated access token and its expiration date and time will be printed to the console.

### Kafka Instance Maintenance

The `managed_kafka.sh` script supports creating, listing, and deleting Kafka clusters.

1. To create a cluster, run `managed_kafka.sh --create <cluster name>`. Progress will be printed as the cluster is prepared and provisioned.
1. To list existing clusters, run `managed_kafka.sh --list`.
1. To remove an existing cluster, run `managed_kafka.sh --delete <cluster ID>`.
1. To use kafka bin scripts against pre existing kafka cluster, run `managed_kafka.sh --certgen`. The cert generation is already performed at the end of `--create`. Point the `--command-config flag` to the generated app-services.properties in the working directory.
* If there is already 2 service accounts pre-existing you must delete 1 of them for this script to work
